# Easysite Import
`easysite_import` is a module for importing bookmarks from the SocialServices database that Easysite uses.

On the users bookmarks page, it adds a list of the bookmark lists in the SocialServices database for that user. The user can then choose a list to import into ding_bookmark.

This module is implemented with the prerequisite that you have a dump of the SocialServices database and the source code to your easysite.
